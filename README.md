# Voronoi Visualizer
Visual aid for understanding what voronoi diagrams are.
Powered by [Voronoi](https://github.com/CooperCorona/Voronoi).
Generate random voronoi diagrams or input your own points to create a custom voronoi diagram.

### New Features
* Click anywhere in the diagram to add a new point.
* Drag a point to watch the diagram update in real time (only functions for diagrams with <= 64 points because diagrams with higher number of points take too long to render).
* Mono Mode Update: You can now choose any number and type of colors to color your Voronoi Diagram (Mono is now the only coloring scheme; others have been deprecated).
